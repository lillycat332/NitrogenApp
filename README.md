# NitrogenApp

# What is it?

Nitrogen is a tool for viewing iOS system info. It is written in Swift with SwiftUI, and minimizes use of libr aries where possible.
Currently, it can show battery level and charge state, OS and Kernel version+information, device name + device specs.

# Why?

Because 90% of the "spec apps" on the app store are fake, and the ones that aren't don't fit my needs and aren't visually appealing. Apps should fit the platform they are on, and Nitrogen aims to do this by using entirely native Swift code and SwiftUI.

# Why BSD? Why not [insert other license]?

I used the BSD License because I believe GPL is not truly FOSS due to it's viral license, and BSD is much better in this regard.
